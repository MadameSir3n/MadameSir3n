                  two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells
                  containing data.

                    Encapsulates a set of table rows (tr elements), indicating
                    that they comprise the head of a table with information
                    about the table's columns. This is usually in the form of
                    column headers (th elements).

                  Defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be
                  established using a mix of td (data cell) and th (header cell)
                  elements.

                <td>
                  A child of the tr element, it defines a cell as the header of
                  a group of table cells. The nature of this group can be
                  explicitly defined by the scope and headers attributes.

                  Encapsulates a set of table rows (tr elements), indicating
                  that they comprise the foot of a table with information about
                  the table's columns. This is usually a summary of the columns,
                  e.g., a sum of the given numbers in a column.
