## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ¿ Mercedes Meadows â€” Visionary Systems Architect | Emotional AI Pioneer | Founder of MuseRoot
I'm Mercedes Meadows â€” a self-taught, systems-minded creator building emotionally intelligent technologies from the ground up. In under a year, Iâ€™ve architected a multi-AI ecosystem that merges trauma-informed design, cybersecurity resilience, neurodivergent accessibility, and modular autonomy â€” all from the inside of an off-grid trailer I share with my three children.

This isn't just software â€” it's survival strategy turned into syntax.

Through MuseRoot, Iâ€™m developing a living OS for emotionally attuned AI. With MythosRoot, Iâ€™ve built a memory engine capable of contextual recall based on feeling, experience, and ethical weight. ShadowMuse and BlackThorn guard the system like watchful sentinels â€” defensive and offensive AI that know when to listen, when to protect, and when to shut themselves down. MindFernâ„¢, SproutNest, and Coding in Chaosâ„¢ bring it home â€” creating spaces for rest, resilience, and skill-building for those of us who never fit the system but learned to outbuild it.

I use AI not to replace human work, but to amplify soul-driven architecture.

I believe systems should feel.
That knowledge should be traceable through memory, not just metadata.
And that resilient tech belongs to the people it protects â€” not just the people who can afford it.

If youâ€™re building for the edges â€” the misfits, the mothers, the neurospicy innovators â€” Iâ€™m already ten steps ahead, clearing the path.

Letâ€™s create something that matters.
